Instructions
============

There are two ways to join lines. You can join the line your cursor is on with the next line by hitting Ctrl-J (for both mac and pc).
You can alternatively join multiple lines by selecting them and hitting Ctrl-J (again, ctrl for mac as well).

By hitting Ctrl-J, you join the lines with a single space character separating them. If you don't want that space character there, press Ctrl-Shift-J instead.
